# Development of Mesh Deformation Methods for External Aerodynamics Simulations  
**Imperial College London â€“ MSc Thesis (in collaboration with McLaren Racing)**

This repository contains the public version of my MSc thesis, conducted within the **CFD R&D team at McLaren Racing** as part of the Aeronautics programme at Imperial College London.

The project investigates the development and evaluation of **PDE-based mesh deformation methods** to support accurate simulation of **external aerodynamics** under large, random vehicle displacements. Techniques such as Laplace, Linear Elasticity, and Biharmonic equations are compared in terms of mesh quality preservation, numerical stability, and implementation robustness.

The thesis includes:
- A detailed benchmark of mesh deformation solvers
- Considerations on mesh quality metrics and Jacobian control
- Use of stochastic car motion models to simulate realistic track behaviour
- Mathematical tools applicable to numerical physics, simulation, and geometry handling
